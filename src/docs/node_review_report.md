## 📈 Phase 2: Node Evaluation Results

### 4D Framework Scoring
Applied the 4D Node Relevance Framework to evaluate each node:

| Dimension | Weight | Average Score | Status |
|-----------|--------|---------------|---------|
| **Relevance** | 25% | 4.1/5 | 🟢 Strong |
| **Composability** | 25% | 4.6/5 | 🟢 Strong |
| **Actionability** | 25% | 4.0/5 | 🟢 Strong |
| **Semantic Clarity** | 25% | 3.4/5 | 🟡 Moderate |

### Node-by-Node Analysis:
- **🟢 Strong Nodes (4):** Start, Ask Input, Send Message, End
- **🟡 Moderate Nodes (3):** Process Data, Save Data, API Call
- **🔴 Weak Nodes (1):** Decision (clarity issues)
